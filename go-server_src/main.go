This API is for the consumption of Content Providers. It provides end-user subscription,  unsubscription, query information and notification interfaces for DSP.  <br><br> NGSSM's subscription API is inbound, meaning that, for this API, NGSSM acts as the server and request direction is from the client to NGSSM. Subscription APIs include  methods:  - Generate Authcode,  - ReGenerate Authcode,  - Create Subscription and  - Cancel Subscription - Query Subscriber Info   As the names imply, Authcode methods are used to create a one-time password token at OTPS,  Create Subscription is used to create an offer subscription at NGSSM,  whereas Cancel Subscription is used to cancel an existing offer subscription on NGSSM
