  description: |
    Enkudo DSP is Telenityâ€™s next-generation digital services platform to monetize the 
    digital services and content served on top of the customer network. Enkudo DSP solution 
    enables customers to subscribe/purchase digital content of their choice (ranging from 
    games, video stream, educational content, etc.) through a mobile application and web 
    portal with a variety of payment options, on a revenue share business model.
    This API is for the consumption of Content Providers. It provides end-user subscription, 
    unsubscription, query information and notification interfaces for DSP. 
    <br><br>
    NGSSM's subscription API is inbound, meaning that, for this API, NGSSM acts as the server
    and request direction is from the client to NGSSM. Subscription APIs include  methods: 
    - Generate Authcode, 
    - ReGenerate Authcode, 
    - Create Subscription and 
    - Cancel Subscription
    - Query Subscriber Info 
    As the names imply, Authcode methods are used to create a one-time password token at OTPS, 
    Create Subscription is used to create an offer subscription at NGSSM, 
    whereas Cancel Subscription is used to cancel an existing offer subscription on NGSSM

      summary : Authorization Code Request
      description: |
        'Before issuing any requests to the endpoint, web applications need to be authenticated. 
        For authentication, Client Credentials grant of OAuth 2.0 specification is used. 
        Please refer to  for more information on OAuth.http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4
        The client authentication follows these steps:
        - Client encodes its key and password into an encoded set of credentials.
        - Client makes a request to OAuth/token?grant_type=client_credentials endpoint and 
          passes the credentials information in the POST request.
        - If successfully authenticated, client receives an access token in the response.
        - Client includes this bearer token when making requests to the DCB API'

        'Regenerate Auth Code API has the same basic functionality of Generate API with one caveat: 
        It first invalidates the current Auth Code and only then generates a new random password 
        and sends it to the application. The created is password is not sent to the subscriber.
        The application can send the password to the subscriber by any means it prefers.
        For Regenerate Auth Code API to be called successfully, Generate Auth Code must have been 
        called first and there should be a valid Transaction ID from that API call'
